            <div class="why-this-works">
                <p><strong>Why This Works:</strong> This 1500-calorie diet for Day 1 helps boost your energy and lose weight. Warm water with lime and honey kick starts your metabolism, maintains the internal pH, and boosts your immunity. Millet idlis are super healthy, and peanut and coconut chutney will provide your body with healthy fats and protein. Choose sambar or egg whites as a source of lean protein, which will keep you active throughout the day. Green tea helps flush toxins out and keeps your hunger pangs at bay. Apples or grapes are good sources of vitamins and minerals. Ragi balls provide energy, calcium, and fiber. Have any vegetable curry and a cup of rasam to support your body functions. Buttermilk and curd strengthen the digestive system and immunity. Marie biscuits, though not healthy, will help you relax with a cup of green tea. Avoid having white or brown rice for dinner, and consume no more than two rotis. You can have one extra cup of daal if you feel hungry. Drinking warm milk with turmeric will prevent you from snacking on junk and help you sleep better.</p>

Check with your doctor to know if you are allowed to do vigorous cardio or weight training before you start exercising.</p>

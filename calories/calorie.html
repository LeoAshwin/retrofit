                <h2>High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)</h2>
                <p>HIIT involves short bursts of exercise at more than 70% of your aerobic capacity, alternating between high-intensity activity and rest periods. This method is effective for burning calories quickly in 30 minutes or less.</p>
                
                <div class="exercise">
                    <h3>High-Knee Running</h3>

                <h2>Other Considerations</h2>
                <p><strong>Cardio vs. Weight Training:</strong> While cardio burns more calories per session, weight training builds muscle mass, which burns more calories at rest. A balanced fitness regimen including both can maximize calorie burn.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Warm-Up and Cool Down:</strong> Warming up prepares your body for exercise and reduces injury risk, while cooling down helps your heart rate return to normal. Modify exercises if you have injuries, limited mobility, or health conditions.</p>
                
                <p>Consult with a doctor, personal trainer, or physical therapist to ensure safe and effective exercise tailored to your needs.</p>
